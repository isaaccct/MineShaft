# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the maintainers of this repository before making a change.

## Help in documentation
You may found our developers focus on developing code and developer documents, and user guide may
be not updated and not sufficient for new users. We welcome your help in adding those details into
the `docstring` inside the source code files.

Another way to contribute is to create a serials of blog or articles to fillin the area our document
was not covered. And then create an issue to tell us adding your tutorial and blog into our `README`.
We will verify if the information matches the latest version of code in repository and review the
overall quality before putting the link of the website or blog on our `README` as a supplementary of
our document.

## Pull Request Process
Only pull request based on a issue will be accepted, any new feature, bug fix and other change
must have a corresponding issue created first.

Any class, method, function and module starts with `docstring` descripting the functionality of
the block of code about to be created (why we need it, what does it do, how do we use it). The
`docstring` defines the code to be written, before the code is writen allowing others to review
and contribute to the same code block if capable.

> ℹ️ We follow the `numpydoc` format of `docstring` and generate documents with Sphinx.

Document about the application programming interface of the function or class should be ready
before the pull request is submitted.

Maintainers of the repository shall review the pull request before approving the merge.
